# Quad-Solver-GUI

As stated in my last repo, this is the GUI version of my Quadratic equation solver aka "Quad Solver". This version is written completely in Python using the Kivy framework. Features include:
    • Preview: Preview the equation after entering the requested values (a, b, and c)
    • Calculate: Solve the previewed equation and give the result.

The solving functionality or mechanism is the same i used in my previous repo which i suggest you check out "Quad Solver2".
